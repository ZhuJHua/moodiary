## 🚀 Installation guide

### Third party SDK

Some capabilities need to apply for third-party SDKS, and the following service providers provide free versions, and the obtained keys are configured in the lab.

#### Weather service

- [QWeather](https://dev.qweather.com/docs/api/)

#### Map service

- [Tianditu](http://lbs.tianditu.gov.cn/server/MapService.html)

#### Intelligent assistant

- [Tencent Hunyuan](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1729/97731)

### Direct mounting

Use it by downloading the compiled installation package in Release, or manually compiling it if you don't have the platform you need.

### Manual compilation

## 📝 More description

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

> In the experimental stage

Today, more and more industry products are beginning to incorporate AI technology, which undoubtedly greatly improves our experience. However, for diary applications, it is not acceptable to hand over the data to a large model because it is not certain that the data will be used for training. Therefore, a better approach is to adopt a local model. Although local models may not be as powerful as large models due to size limitations, they can still provide necessary help to a certain extent. 

Currently, I have the following tasks integrated into the source code:

#### SQuAD task based on Bert pre-trained model

I used MobileBert for the SQuAD task, which is a simple machine reading comprehension task. You can ask it questions and it will return the answers you need. The model files are in the `.tflite` format required by TensorFlow Lite, so you can add your own model files to the `assets/tflite` directory.

Thanks to the following open source projects:

- [Chinese MobileBERT](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-MobileBERT)
- [Mobilebert](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mobilebert)
- [ChineseSquad](https://github.com/junzeng-pluto/ChineseSquad)
